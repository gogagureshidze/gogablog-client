              : I built this blog platform with a huge dose of love ❤️ as a
              full-stack solo dev project in high school. But it's more than
              just a site to show off my code. It’s a home — for me, for my
              friends, and for all the funny interests and ideas we turned into
              app.

              ✨ This wasn’t just an app. This was real. And if you were part of
              it — even for a second — you’re part of it forever.

              We weren’t just users. We were friends, jokers, dreamers, and
              creators.
              <br />
              We made something a little bit silly and a Cozy.
              <br />
              <br />
              When the comments go quiet and the updates stop — remember, we
              were here. We lived it.
